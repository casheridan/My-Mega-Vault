# Revising vs Editing
---
#### *Revising:* 
* Treats writing as a work in progress
* Focuses on new possibilites both within and beyond the text
* Focuses on new questions or goals
* Considers both purpose and readersâ€™ needs
* Encourages further discovery
#### *Editing:*
* Treats writing as an almost-finished product
* Addresses obvious errors and deficiencies
* Focuses on the draft and does not suggest new avenues for discussion Considers grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style
* Polishes up the essay
