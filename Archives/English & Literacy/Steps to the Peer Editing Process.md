# Steps to the Peer Editing Process
---
1. The writer distributes copies of the draft to each member of the writing group.(Ideally, the group should not exceed four students.)
2. The writer distributes a cover letter, setting an agenda for the group.
3. The members read the cover letter.
4. The writer then reads the draft aloud, while members follow along, under lining passages and making notes to prepare themselves to discuss the draft.
5. Members ask questions that help the writer identify concepts that need further elaboration or clarification.
6. Discussion focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of the draft appropriate to the stage of writing and the writerâ€™s concerns. (Even in the early stage, readers and the writer should sustain discussion for at least ten minutes before the next student takes a turn as writer.)
