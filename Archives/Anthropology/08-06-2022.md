# Preservation
---
Preservation depends on the material you are trying to preserve.

The environment matters in preservation as well. Arid environments work well with organic materials. Caves are great for preserving as they are dryer than the outside usually (think Cerro Gordo). Frozen environments work well with persihable remains as it prevents bactieria from living.
