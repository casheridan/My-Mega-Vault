# History of European

### What the 'peans thought 
- Deity created all life on Earth
- God created a hierarchy of organisms with Humans at the top
- Thought the Earth was yungbl√ºd
- Archbishop Ussher (that one DJ dude from that one song parodied by that one minecraft YouTuber), 1650
- Earth created in 4004 BC
- Life on Earth is/was static

### What really happened üóø
- Changes only due to big natural catastrophes/disasters or decay
- Catastrophic events were seen as God's punishment for being naughty boys
- Catastrophic events also wipe out certain species like those damn unicorns
- God creates new species to replace those removed
- Geologists discovered Earth is always changing like how my poop sock gets bigger and bigger till my mom finds it and I get beat for my crimes against the human race

- Change is gradual over long periods of time
- Change for this is Uniformitarianism
- Big sads (Extinctions) have happened
- New species appear after ExEvs
- Not always explaned by catastrophies

### Humanity is old as shit
- Artifacts associated with extinct Ice Age animals
- These indicate humans have been around for a long time

### Evolution baybee üòé
- Evolution is real
- 1800s Naturalists are the real Gs of this theory
- Jean-Baptiste Lamarck AD 1809 was the first big brain
- How do?
	- Animal get trait from parent
	- I get jeans from my parents and can't grow a beard, am ugly, thanks dad

4 mechanisms for Biological Evolution
1. Natural Selection
2. Mutation
3. Genetic Drift
4. Gene Flow

#### Natural Selection ü¶ç
The process by which some individuals in a population, due to having more adaptive trais, have greater reproductive success, there by increasing the frequency of the adaptive traits
- **The Big Brains**
	- Charles Darwin (1809-1882)
	- Alfred Wallace (1823-1913)
- 1858: Darwin & Wallace's theory of natural selection presented at same meeting
- 1859: Darwin's book *On the Origin of Species published*
- How do?
	- Population: Group of individuals of same species, in same are, breeding with each other for generations (Sex. üëç)
	- Reproductive success: Success in having offspring (big sad, mone gone)
	- Every individual does not survive to reproduce: this is because usually more individuals in population than environment can support (Based Chads add more Based Chads to the gene pool)
	- Variation among individuals: Natural selection can only occur if there is variation among individuals within population
	- Adaptive trait: Trait that increasees reproductive success (Like my big brain üòé)
	- Adaptiveness fo trait depends on environment (ü¶ç)
- Darwin is a birb mass murderer (called it), murdered and stuffed so, so many finches to determine how natural selection occurs
