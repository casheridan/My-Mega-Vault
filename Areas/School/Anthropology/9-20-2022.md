(üêé Juan)

Big word: **Deoxyribonucleic Acid** (DNA)
Def: Double stranded molecule which contains jeansüëñ

Big word: **Chromosome** (The thing which I only have two)
Def: In the cell nucleus and is a discrete unit of DNA

Humans have 46 chromosomes 23 pairs
Apples: 34
Fly: 12

Genotype: Genetic code for the trait
Phenotype: Expression of that trait

Dominant allele: expressed if present
Recessive allele: masked if co-occurs with a dominant allele
co-dominant alleles: both influence trait

| There are 2 alleles | Dominant Free (F) | Recessive Attached (f) |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| There are 3 genotypes | **FF** | **Ff** |
| There are 2 phenotypes | **Ff** | **ff** |

This is literally a punnet square...

Mutation: Genes that aren't passed down but occur when a gene created and a shift happens in the alleles

Gene Flow: Exchange of genes between populations

Species: Group of organisms in which individuals interbreed & produce fertile offspring

| Horse       | Donkey      | Mule           |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Can Produce | Can Produce | Cannot Produce |
| Species     | Species     | Not a Species  |
