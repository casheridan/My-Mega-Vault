## Classification of Matter
---

> See Figure 0.1 in Notebook

### Terms:
- Pure Substance
	- Cannot be seperated by physical means
- Element
	- Cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances
- Compond
	- Combination of two or more elements
- Mixture
	- Can be seperated by physical means
- Homogenous
	- Composition of the mixture is uniform throughout
- Heterogeneous
	- Composition is not uniform

## States of Matter
---
The different states of matter determine by the degrees of movement between molecules and the degrees of movement is caused by attractive forces.

## Chemical Properties vs Physical Properties
---
Physical Properties include:
- Density
- Temperature
- Boiling point
- Color

> [!Examples]
> Melting, Shredding, Boiling, Chopping

Chemical Properties include:
- Paper catch fire with a lighter
- Fe ore will not catch fire with a lighter
- Sodium racts with water
- Polyethene doesn't with water

> [!Examples]
> Combustion, Rotting, Rusting, Digestion

Some of these examples will change based on what's going on with the object.
