## Introduction

Flip Flops are essentially ways to store data, the output (which we define as Q) will stay the same unless determined by the data.

We usually pair these with clocks, designated with CLK, as the first input and either 1 (D FF) or 2 (SR & JK FF) other inputs.

>The basic Flip Flop starts with the D FF. SR & JK FFs can be mostly built with a D FF
