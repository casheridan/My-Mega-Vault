## Introduction
---
Flip Flops are essentially ways to store data, the output (which we define as Q) will stay the same unless determined by the data.

We usually pair these with clocks, designated with CLK, as the first input and either 1 (D FF) or 2 (SR & JK FF) other inputs.

> Flip Flops can be built from latches most commonly the SR Latch

#### <u>Terms</u>
- Rising Edge: When the electrical signal goes from LOW -> HIGH
- Falling Edge: When electrical signal goes from HIGH -> LOW

- Rising Sensitive: CLK value is 1 when Rising Edge occurs
- Falling Sensitive: CLK value is 1 when Falling Edge occurs
- Level Sensitive: CLK value is 1 during the duration of the HIGH
