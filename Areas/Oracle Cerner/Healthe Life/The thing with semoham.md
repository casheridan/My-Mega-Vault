Hey Kay, decided to stay on a bit longer and I was able to generate a portal invite through the healthe life registration conversation. I ran through the steps and I was able to unlock Charles Semoham. I'm not sure exactly what did it but there was a freeze for LDAP credentials that ended at around 5. It may have been related because it didn't work until after 5 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Just wanted to let you know
