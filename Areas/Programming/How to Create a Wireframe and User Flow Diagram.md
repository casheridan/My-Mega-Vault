A wireframe is a simplified diagram that shows the layout and functionality of an app. It is often created as a blueprint for the app's design, and helps to visualize how the app will work and how users will interact with it.

To design a wireframe:

1.  Start by sketching out the layout of the app. Think about the content and features you want to include, and how you want them to be organized on the screen.
    
2.  Determine the navigation and flow of the app. How will users move from one screen to another, and what actions will they be able to take on each screen?
    
3.  Add elements such as buttons, text fields, and other UI elements to the wireframe. These should be placed in logical locations and labeled with descriptive text to indicate their purpose.
    
4.  Refine the wireframe by adding visual details and styling elements. This might include colors, fonts, and other design elements that will be used in the final app.
    

A user flow diagram illustrates the steps a user will take to accomplish a task within the app. It is a visual representation of the user journey, and helps to identify any potential issues or bottlenecks in the user experience.

To design a user flow diagram:

1.  Identify the task that the user will be trying to accomplish. This might be something like setting up a budget, tracking expenses, or paying a bill.
    
2.  Break the task down into smaller steps. For each step, consider what actions the user will need to take and what screens they will need to interact with.
    
3.  Create a flowchart to represent the steps in the process. Use arrows to show the sequence of steps, and label each step with a descriptive title.
    
4.  Consider any potential branching paths or alternate flows. For example, a user might encounter an error message or need to make a decision that affects the flow of the process.
    
5.  Refine the user flow diagram by adding details such as screen mockups and annotations to explain the actions and decisions that the user will need to make.
