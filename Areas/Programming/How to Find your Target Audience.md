There are several ways to determine the target audience for an app:

1.  Define the purpose and features of the app. This will help you identify the types of people who would be most interested in using the app. For example, a personal finance app would likely be most useful to people who are interested in managing their money and tracking their expenses.
    
2.  Conduct market research. This can involve surveying potential users to gather information about their needs and preferences, or analyzing data from similar apps to identify trends and patterns.
    
3.  Consider the demographics of your target audience. This might include factors such as age, gender, income level, location, and education level.
    
4.  Determine the user journey. This is the path a user takes as they interact with your app, from discovery to installation and beyond. Understanding the user journey can help you identify the types of people who are most likely to use your app.
    
5.  Consider the platforms and devices your target audience uses. If you know that your target audience primarily uses iOS devices, for example, you may want to prioritize developing an app for the iOS platform.
    

It's important to note that your target audience may evolve over time as you gather more information and data about your users. It's important to continuously gather feedback and data about your users to ensure that your app is meeting their needs and preferences.
