To create an app that tracks personal finances, you would need to consider the following steps:

1.  Define the scope and purpose of the app. Consider what features you want to include, such as budgeting, expense tracking, bill payment reminders, and investment tracking.
    
2.  Determine the target audience for the app. This will help you to design the app in a way that meets the needs and preferences of your users.
    
3.  Create wireframes and a user flow for the app. Wireframes are simplified diagrams that show the layout and functionality of the app. A user flow diagram illustrates the steps a user will take to accomplish a task within the app.
    
4.  Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The UI is the visual design of the app, including the colors, fonts, and layout. The UX is how easy it is for users to navigate and use the app.
    
5.  Develop the app. This will involve writing code to implement the features and functionality you have defined. You may choose to use a framework such as React Native or Flutter to build the app.
    
6.  Test the app thoroughly to ensure it is bug-free and user-friendly.
    
7.  Launch the app and promote it to potential users. You may want to consider using app stores or social media to reach a wider audience.
    

It is also important to consider security and privacy when creating a personal finance app. You should implement measures such as encryption and secure servers to protect users' financial data.
