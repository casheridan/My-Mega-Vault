## Finding the Table of Contents in Prefmaint
1. Go to prefmaint on a windows machine with millenium installed
2. Sign in with either LDAP or `junituser_admin`[^1]
3. Open the 'Preference Form'
4. Select 'PowerChart' in Application
5. Select the dropdown for Position and type 'DBA'
6. Press enter if you see 'DBA'
7. Click 'Search for Preferences.'
8. Open the 'Chart' Tree

The tabs seen are different components that can be seen in the PowerChart TOC[^2]

## Modifying the TOC
From here we can go two different ways, set up our own tab or take over another tab from the TOC

1. [[Adding a Tab to Prefmaint]]
2. [[Modifying a Prefmaint Tab (stealing & most prefered)]]
