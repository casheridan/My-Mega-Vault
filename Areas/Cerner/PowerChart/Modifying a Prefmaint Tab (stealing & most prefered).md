## Modifying the tab
> [!INFO]
We will be using the __Document Workflow Component__ as the example for this, not all components are the same as they may be called differently with *REPORT_NAME* and *REPORT_PARAM*.
>In order for our component to show up it must be properly set up in __Bedrock__ see [[Configuring our MPage Component]] for information on how to do this

---

The tab we want to modify is usually a 'Discern Report' tab, find a suitable tab in prefmaint, to get to prefmaint follow: [[Modifying PowerChart Table of Contents#Finding the TOC in Prefmaint]]

1. Find a suitible tab (try to find one without a __DND__ (do not delete))
2. Change the *VIEW_CAPTION* to either your name or the component we are using
4. On the tree view (left) click on the "+" next to the highlighted tab
5. Select the tab with the same name under the highlighted tab

The two that we will be concered with is *REPORT_NAME* and *REPORT_PARAM*. We might not use both but those are our main concern.

See [[REPORT_NAME Breakdown]] for more information on what we are actually putting in the *REPORT_NAME* parameter
