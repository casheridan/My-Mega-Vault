## Coming of the French Revolution
---
- Expressed enlightened ideals
- Financial Crisis in France was a main factor in bringing the revolution
- Based on *Social* and *Economical* divisions
- Made possible by **failure** in leadership (government)

#### Expressed enlightened ideals
Ideas like liberalism

#### Financial Crisis
The French has exsausted some resources to help America with their revolution (this was based on revenge for the war between Britain and France before the American Revolution). Although they didn't use up a lot of resources.

### Phases of the Revolution
---
- Constitutional: Reform of the Monarchy, Reform of France 1789 -> 1792
- Republican: War, "The Terror" 1792 -> 1794
- The Directory 1794 -> 1799
- Napoleonic Rule, Expansion 1799 -> 1815

#### Constitutional
King not killed yet but new government is being made and they didn't know what to do with the king yet

#### Republican
Most violent phase, the king is killed and lots of executions

#### The Directory
The governing power of France (not popular), Napoleon helped save The Directory but then became the Emporer later on. This is part/start of Napolionic Period.


### Social Tensions in the Old Regime
---
- Not a conflict between the nobility and the gourgeoisie
- Legally, **three estates**:
	-  First = Clergy
	-  Second = Nobility
	-  Third = Everyone Else
- Division between nobility and bourgeoisie is porous, but climbing the social ladder get harder in 18th century
- Enlightenment ideas and the elite: Voltaire attacks privilege, Montesquieu attacks arbitrary power (*parlements* an antidote)
- Peasants are squeezed from all sides: tithe, rents, fees, corveé, hunting rights
- Infaltion helps grow economy, but crushes peasants, tradesmen, laborers
- Bread prices in 1788 50% of income, 1789 80%
- Less consumption drives unemployment (up to 50%)

#### Nobility
Nobility is guarenteed if you own land from the king. The only other ways to get into nobility and climb the social ladder was to serve the king in certain ways, like serving as a general or commander in his military.

#### Enlightenment getting a voice
Voltaire attacked privilage by saying that the nobility that they didn't earn their status but got it from heretitary means with no work other than being born into it.

Montesquieu attacked arbitrary power

#### Peasants
Fees like paying to use a public service like a Mill where a peasants couldn't own one outright. Too much rent, owing a fee for their labor like paying for the roads they built.

#### Inflation
With the growing of prices, it helped the commerce workers like merchants where they would take advantange of the inflation. Peasants would owe 50% of their income in order to get bread, and 80% after 1789. Unemployment also did not help with the production of these goods.

### Addressing the Financial Crisis
---
#### Fiscal Crisis and Political Compromise
King Louis XVI was afraid of a lower class popular revolt. So he calls a Estates General in 1788 which consists of the 3 estates. But this calling causes some discorse. The 3rd estate wanted to double its membership and voting power by head instead of by order. The issues of pesants are put into a *cahiers de doléances*

Louis backs down and the 3rd estate goes seperatly as the National Assembly, plan being to create a new governemt (but still with the king). They had to convene in a tennis court, this is where the Tennis Court Oath came into being (June 20, 1789)

The King orders all of his delegates and nobles to join the National Assembly.


### Revolts
---
#### National Assembly Meetings
As The National Assembly meets to discuss a wide range of reforms. With the fear of counter-revolution the sans-culottes stormed and took over the **Bastile** so they can get some arms and have access to *some* jail cells. There is a huge fear called "The Great Fear" of counter revolution and invasion, this lead to forming of militias and attacks on manor houses in August. "The October Days": market women of Paris march to Versailles (action with bread prices/King is resistant, force King to march back with them to Paris) , break in, march the King back to Paris. The results of all this is The Bastille going to the National Assembly and The Great Fear causes the elimination of hereditary privileges.

#### The Terror
- **Committee of Public Saftey** (12)
