### The Composition Pyramid
1. The top of this inverted pyramid corresponds to the early stages of writing. At this point, members of the writing group should identify the situation the writer is responding to (for example, homelessness, inequality, or air pollution), the issue the writer has defined (for example, the economic versus the social costs of homelessness), the thesis or argument the writer advances, and the extent to which the writer addresses a given audience appropriately.
    
2. The middle portion of the pyramid corresponds to alater stage of the writing process, the point at which members of the group should move on to discuss the writer’s organization and use of sources. Is the argument logically organized? Has the writer integrated quotations smoothly into the paper? Is the evidence relevant, recent, and credible?
    
3. Finally, the bottom of the pyramid corresponds to the final stages of drafting. As the writer’s focus shifts to grammar and style, so should the group’s. Questions to ask: Is this specific language appropriate to the intended audience? Has the writer presented the argument in ways that will compel readers — even those who disagree — to listen?
